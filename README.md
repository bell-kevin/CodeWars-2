8 kyu kata represent a beginner level.
At this level the kata is only challenging for users new to programming.
This includes programming tasks such as:

- Defining a simple function (i.e. hello world)
- Basic variable assignments
- Fixing basic syntax issues
- Trivial algorithms such as basic if/else statements

7 kyu kata represent a beginner programming level..
At this level the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge.
Tasks such as:

- Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values
- Basic data type manipulations
- Basic functional or object-oriented concepts
- Basic Regular Expressions

<h2 align="center">Yellow (Novice)</h2>

<h3 align="center">:ledger::ledger::ledger:6 Kyu:ledger::ledger::ledger:</h3>

6 kyu kata represent a novice programming level. At this level the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complex language features. It includes:

- Complex language features (closures, scopes, monads, etc)
- Complex OOP/Functional concepts
- Basic Design Patterns
- Complex Regular Expressions

<h3 align="center">:ledger::ledger::ledger:5 Kyu:ledger::ledger::ledger:</h3>

5 kyu kata represent a novice programming level.
At this level the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging.
It includes:

- Advanced regular expression usage

<h2 align="center">Blue (Competent)</h2>

<h3 align="center">:blue_book::blue_book::blue_book:4 Kyu:blue_book::blue_book::blue_book:</h3>

4 kyu kata represent a competent programming level.
At this level the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete.
They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms
- Advanced design patterns
- Understanding intricate business requirements
- Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

<h3 align="center">:blue_book::blue_book::blue_book:3 Kyu:blue_book::blue_book::blue_book:</h3>

3 kyu kata represent a competent programming level.
At this level the kata are similar to 4 kyu but are more challenging.
They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing advanced algorithms
- Ability to implement advanced requirements in a scalable fashion
- Basic AI/machine learning algorithms
- Detailed usage of advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism and cryptography

<h2 align="center">Purple (Proficient)</h2>

<h3 align="center">:kimono::kimono::kimono:2 Kyu:kimono::kimono::kimono:</h3>

2 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level.
At this level kata require a mature understanding of complex programming concepts - concepts such as:

- Complex AI/machine learning algorithms
- Reverse engineering techniques
- Basic interpreters and compilers
- Basic mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a basic markdown parser)

<h3 align="center">:kimono::kimono::kimono:1 Kyu:kimono::kimono::kimono:</h3>

1 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level.
At this level kata are similar to 2 kyu but more challenging.
They may include concepts such as:

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
