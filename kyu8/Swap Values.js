//* Swap Values

// I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.

// Can you figure out what's wrong here?

const swapValues = (arr) => arr.reverse();

console.log([0, 1]);
console.log([1, 0]);
